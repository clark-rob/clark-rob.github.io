## GH Pages

#### Portfolio
You can only host 1 "User Site" per account/organization on the URL `username.github.io` so you are using that as your portfolio since it will be the showcase of the rest of the projects on your GH account.  Read more about [User Sites here](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/#project-pages)

#### Projects
GH allows you to host other web sites as “Project Sites” which can be on the URLs `username.github.io/project_names`. You will have 4 projects which you will launch as “Project Sites” and you can have an unlimited number of those, we hope you add more than 4 after the program!
